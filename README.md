# ARDUINO-BASED-FIRE-FIGHTING-ROBOT
This project showcases the creation of an Arduino-based fire-fighting robot that can detect and put out fires. The robot is fitted with flame sensors, a temperature sensor, and a gas sensor to effectively identify fire, changes in temperature, and smoke levels. When a fire is detected, the system triggers a water pump to extinguish it. Beyond
its fire-fighting abilities, the robot includes real-time monitoring and alerting features through the ESP8266 WiFi module and the Blynk IoT platform. This setup enables notifications about fire, temperature, and smoke to be
sent to the user's mobile device, allowing for remote monitoring and control. Additionally, the system can detect
obstacles using an infrared (IR) sensor, improving its ability to navigate autonomously in dangerous
environments. The design of the robot aims to offer a cost-effective and efficient solution for fire detection and
control in various settings, including industrial, residential, and commercial spaces.
